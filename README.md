# App Description

This is an open-source flashcard app created by Morgan O'Shaughnessey. It is currently configured to learn the Japanese Hiragana alphabet, but it may be adapted to learn any alphabet.

The foreign-language characters are located in /src/data/characters.jsx. Here, the characters are stored in an object and grouped according to the radio buttons in the UI. Hiragana organizes nicely into 5 groups, which is why there are 5 groups and 5 corrisponding radio buttons.

Should you adapt this app to a different alphabet, I would suggest the following wokflow:

1. Determine the number of groups you will need. If 5, simply update characters.jsx with the new alphabet.

2. If more or less than 5 groups, edit the characters.jsx file to reflect your groups as needed and then sequence the correct number of groups in the radioValues array found on line 11 of /src/components/Controls.jsx;

3. In the "characters" object keys of src/data/characters.tsx, e stands for English and j stands for Japanese. You may wish to update the letters to reflect the languages you are adapting the app for. Should you choose to do so, you will also need to update the abbreviations on line 14 of /src/components/Flashcard.jsx;

Good luck and happy hacking! Drop me a line at developer@theMorganObject.dev if you'd like to say hi, I'd love to hear from you!

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
